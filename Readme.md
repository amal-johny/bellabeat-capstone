# Bellabeat Fitness Tracker Analysis (Google Data Analytics Capstone)

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analytics case study completed as part of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone**. The objective is to analyze smart device usage data to uncover user behavior patterns and generate **data-driven recommendations** to support Bellabeat’s marketing and product strategy.

Bellabeat is a wellness technology company that designs smart devices to help users track daily activity, sleep, and overall health. By leveraging fitness tracker data, this analysis aims to identify opportunities to improve user engagement, retention, and feature alignment.

## Business Objective

* Understand how users interact with fitness tracking devices
* Identify behavioral trends in activity and sleep
* Translate insights into actionable marketing and product recommendations

---

## Dataset

* **Source:** Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data (Kaggle)
* **Period:** 2016
* **Sample Size:** ~33 users
* **Key Tables Used:**

  * Daily activity data
  * Sleep data
  * Hourly step data

> Note: The dataset represents a small sample and may not fully reflect the broader population. Logical data gaps (e.g., missing sleep records for some users) were considered during analysis.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **SQL-style data analysis** (grouping, aggregation, joins)
* **GitHub** for version control and portfolio presentation

## Data Analysis Process

The analysis followed the **Google Data Analytics 6-Step Framework**:

1. **Ask** – Define the business problem and key questions
2. **Prepare** – Understand data sources and limitations
3. **Process** – Clean, validate, and prepare data for analysis
4. **Analyze** – Identify trends and relationships
5. **Share** – Create clear visualizations and insights
6. **Act** – Provide actionable recommendations

---

## Key Insights

* Most users fall into the **moderate activity** category, representing the highest potential segment for incremental growth.
* The relationship between daily steps and sleep duration is **weak and slightly negative**, indicating that increased activity does not automatically lead to better sleep.
* User activity levels are **consistent across weekdays and weekends**, suggesting stable behavior throughout the week.
* **Evening hours show the highest activity levels**, making this the optimal time for user engagement and notifications.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Optimize Notification Timing for Evening Engagement**
   Prioritize activity reminders and motivational notifications during evening hours when users are most active.

2. **Target Moderate-Activity Users for Incremental Growth**
   Encourage moderate users with personalized challenges and gradual goal increases to improve consistency and intensity.

3. **Develop Sleep-Focused Features Independent of Activity Volume**
   Emphasize sleep quality, consistency, and recovery through dedicated sleep insights rather than tying sleep recommendations solely to activity levels.

4. **Maintain Consistent Messaging Across Weekdays and Weekends**
   Avoid assuming higher weekend activity and design engagement strategies that remain effective throughout the week.

## Visual Highlights

Key visualizations supporting this analysis are available in the `visuals/` folder:

* User activity level distribution
* Sleep vs activity relationship
* Weekday vs weekend activity comparison
* Hourly activity patterns

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to perform a complete data analytics workflow—from data cleaning and exploration to insight generation and business recommendations. The findings highlight the importance of timing, user segmentation, and feature independence in designing effective wellness products and marketing strategies.
