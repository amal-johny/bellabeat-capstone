# Bellabeat Fitness Tracker Analysis  
*(Google Data Analytics Capstone Project)*

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analytics case study completed as part of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.  
The analysis uses smart device usage data to identify user behavior patterns and generate **data-driven business recommendations** for Bellabeat, a wellness technology company.

## 🏢 Business Objective
Bellabeat aims to leverage fitness tracker data to:
- Improve user engagement
- Increase daily app usage
- Inform product and marketing strategy

The goal of this analysis is to uncover **activity, sleep, and usage trends** that can guide Bellabeat’s decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset
- Public Fitbit Fitness Tracker dataset
- Includes daily activity, hourly steps, and sleep metrics
- Data cleaned, validated, and transformed before analysis

> Note: Raw data is excluded from this repository to maintain cleanliness and best practices.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **SQL** (exploratory queries)
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Data Visualization**

## 🔍 Key Analysis Steps
1. Data understanding & validation  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Feature engineering (activity levels, weekday/weekend patterns)  
4. Exploratory data analysis  
5. Visualization of user behavior patterns  
6. Business insight generation  

## 💡 Key Insights
- Most users fall into the **moderate activity** category
