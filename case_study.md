4. Recommendations

 1. Optimize Notification Timing for Evening Engagement

Analysis of hourly activity patterns shows that user activity peaks during the evening hours. Bellabeat should prioritize sending activity reminders and motivational notifications during this time window, as users are most active and likely to engage.

**Impact:** Increased notification engagement, stronger habit reinforcement, and higher daily active usage.



2. Target Moderate-Activity Users for Incremental Growth

User segmentation reveals that the majority of Bellabeat users fall into the moderate activity category. These users already demonstrate consistent engagement and are most likely to respond positively to small behavioral nudges.

Bellabeat can design personalized challenges and goal adjustments aimed at encouraging moderate users to increase consistency or intensity gradually.

**Impact:** Improved user retention, increased feature usage, and sustainable behavior change.



3. Develop Sleep-Focused Features Independent of Activity Volume

The analysis shows a weak and slightly negative relationship between daily steps and sleep duration, indicating that increased physical activity does not automatically lead to better sleep outcomes.

Bellabeat should emphasize sleep quality, consistency, and recovery through dedicated sleep insights, bedtime reminders, and stress-reduction features rather than tying sleep recommendations solely to activity levels.

**Impact:** Better alignment with user needs, improved sleep engagement, and stronger differentiation of Bellabeat’s wellness offerings.


4. Maintain Consistent Messaging Across Weekdays and Weekends

Weekday and weekend activity levels show minimal differences, suggesting that user behavior remains relatively consistent throughout the week. Bellabeat should maintain consistent engagement strategies and avoid assuming higher activity levels on weekends.

**Impact:** More reliable engagement strategies and improved effectiveness of reminders across all days.
